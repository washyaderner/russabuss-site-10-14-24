            Trying new things keeps me in a constant state of change and improvement. Here you'll find a selection of some of the different projects I've worked on. I'm always looking to push boundaries and grow, so whether you're working on something standard or super weird, let me take a gander. You can see below that adapting has never been a problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the years, I've sold beats, mixed and mastered singles and albums, created soundtrack-type backing tracks for spoken word, recorded an album's worth of karaoke songs for a KJ client's anniversary present to her husband, used storytelling to produce a track about the lore driving an NFT project, helped with artist branding and web presence, scored a short film, created two beats from scratch for tracks that were recorded on a copyrighted instrumental, so they needed a new original beat to use. I also keep adding to a library of free downloads of meditative sounds taken from field recordings using a stereo mic.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm constantly striving to add to this list, so check out the examples below, and let's talk!

      <ProjectCard
        embedLink="Voodoo Bed EP embed"
        title="Voodoo Bed EP – Dirty Chai"
        content={`Back in 2016 I was approached on Soundcloud by someone who wanted to buy 5 of my beats. Later on he approached me with 5 recorded tracks ready to be mixed and mastered. Keep in mind, when you purchase beats from me, then hire me to mix and master them, I have the ability to alter the original beats if needed. I can fit your desired layout and include any additional edits in tandem with mixing and mastering. Love the beat but want one instrument taken out etc? Easy…

Leon also hired my wife to add some backing vocals on his track called Hallelujah, which added a nice extra dimension to the song. The title track Voodoo Bed was one of my greatest mixing achievements to date. He had taken somewhat of a freestyle approach to his writing, with multiple ad-lib singing backup tracks, most of which needed auto-tune treatment. When it was all said and done, all 14 vocal tracks blended perfectly after 30+ hours of work. You can check it out above.`}

      <ProjectCard
        embedLink="Twenty Poems embed"
        title="Twenty Poems – Leon McConnell"
        content={`For this project I was hired by Leon again, this time to add minimal piano riffs to a 20 track spoken word album, in order to add a musical element, so they'd fit the parameters for distribution to Spotify etc. Early on in the project, I found that to add the most value to his work, my best move would be to create a full environment for these stories to live in, while keeping the vocals fully in focus. The result was 20 full instrumental tracks that greatly exceeded his expectations.

Now, I come from the end of an era where we listened to whole albums, so I still find importance in the order of tracks in an album. I took on this role for this project, and he and I both loved how it turned out. I don't charge extra for this. The best possible version of your final project is our mutual best interest.

To give you an idea of the logistics of a project like this one, I have 100GB of storage with Google Drive. As I work on projects, I continually load bounces to the drive to keep my clients updated on our progress. If you're providing audio tracks for me to build around, those will stay in one folder. We'll also have Drafts, Mixes, and Instrumental MP3s & WAVs.`}

      <ProjectCard
        embedLink="Seed embed"
        title="Seed – All the Things"
        content={`The instrumental for Seed has been one of my favorites since I made it back in early 2017. My cousin Tony aka Teebonix taught me just about everything I know about writing lyrics, so every time I'd write something I'd get his take. He's always been honest with me, which really helped me learn fast. With this particular beat, I had written to it three times, and each time it wasn't good enough. Back to the drawing board.

Along came Holly. Late one night at the peak of inspiration, we were going through beats to see what we could write to, and this one came up. She called dibs and started writing. The lyrics were born from a quote by Cynthia Occelli:

"For a seed to achieve its greatest expression, it must come completely undone.
The shell cracks, its insides come out and everything changes.
To someone who doesn't understand growth, it would look like complete destruction."

Holly wrote the whole song in about an hour, and we recorded it immediately. Producing something this special and perfect is so rare, and it's a great example of what Holly is capable of if you're looking for female vocals.`}

        embedLink="Sloth embed"
        title="Sloth – All the Things"
        content={`Here's another track you can use as an example of Holly's vocals if you'd like to hire us for female vox. She wrote the lyrics on this one too. You can hire her for a hook, whether you have lyrics or need some written. You can also just have her do some background vocal textures/ ad-libs like in the Voodoo Bed album above, on the song Hallelujah.`}

        embedLink="Sleepy EP embed"
        title="Sleepy EP – Russ A Buss"
        content={`The first genre of music I started producing back in 2010 was ambient music. I've always put high importance in a healthy sleep routine, and have studied lucid dreaming, so ambient music was a natural first move. Years later, after honing my craft, I took 8 of my favorite ambient tracks and turned them into the Sleepy EP.

In this album, there are samples of trickling water and other peaceful sounds I've gathered over the years, to really put you in a relaxed state. For many years I worked 2 jobs, and between jobs, or on lunch breaks, power naps were a necessity. Deep Down and Puddle Brain are my favorite power nap friendly tracks from this album. On repeat, they just flow back into themselves for a perfectly calm meditative environment, perfect for naps.`}

      <ProjectCard
        embedLink="Everybody Sleeps embed"
        title="Everybody Sleeps – Free DLs"
        content={`Everyone should be entitled to a good night's rest. In light of this, I have created a Soundcloud account called Everybody Sleeps. All tracks were recorded with a Zoom H1n stereo mic and listened to over and over, so I could remove any stray sounds of seagulls at the beach or squawking birds in the forest, leaving multiple flavors of serene samples you're free to use for a good nights sleep.

All of them are set to repeat smoothly without waking you up, and they're all free downloads. New samples will continue to be added as they're recorded and perfected. If you have any requests for a type of environment that puts you at ease, I'm happy to do my best to accommodate you. Send me a message and we'll see what can be done to help you get some high quality sleep.`}

      <ProjectCard
        embedLink="Mob Studios Lore embed"
        title="Mob Studios Lore – Music for NFT Project"
        content={`In late fall 2022 I started investing in Mob Studios NFTs on the Solana blockchain. In March 2023 my music came up in conversation in their Discord, and one of the founders asked "wen Mob Studios song?" The idea of making music for NFT projects had already crossed my mind, because music NFTs on their own seemed to lack attention in the space during the PFP era; so being able to offer value like this to a project at the time was a completely untapped market.

That weekend I reviewed the full story of the Mob Studios lore in their discord so I could better understand their story. I took that knowledge and sat down to make a custom beat that matched the tone of their story. A dark, apocalyptic world where scientists had created a set of robots designed to preserve the good memories of the human race as the world was devoured by the aftermath of humans. You know how we do…

Anyway, there was so much to work with. I wrote a full story from the perspective of one of the scientists (in their discord, the members of the Mob team retain a "Scientist" role). I took it a level deeper, and worked the names of all 8 members of the core team into the lyrics, staying as true as I could to their actual roles in the project. To say they were happy with the result is an understatement. Hiring me for NFT songs are all subject to… you guessed it! Me doing my own research.`}

            "Russ is by far my favorite person to work with. Aside from his beats being top notch amazing, he's great at mixing and mastering and handling mixing duties on projects I bring him from other producers.
          </p>
          <p>
            We made an EP together and I loved it, so when I wanted to do a separate project in a completely different direction, I asked him for some simple backing tracks since I knew he'd be the perfect fit. He exceeded my expectations by miles… Miles and miles, creating whole worlds for these songs. When I say he brought the project to life, it's a drastic understatement.
          </p>

            I would be happy to work with him on anything. On top of all that he's also a cool friendly person. I'm lucky to know him."
