      content: `Balance. That's what's needed in a professional mix. Your audio needs to sound pristine whether you're listening on your phone's speaker, studio headphones, earbuds, a sound bar, bluetooth speaker, car stereo, or at a show performing w/ your instrumental. Every mix I work on needs to pass all of those tests.

My studio is fully sound treated with professional grade sound treatment, from 2″ thick panels to bass traps. If you're interested, I highly recommend purchasing through Sound Assured: soundassured.com/collections

Things to consider…
Quality: The better your initial recordings/ audio starts out, the easier it is to maximize its potential
Headroom: Make sure you leave plenty of headroom; -6db will get us the best results in the mix
Wet vs Dry: When bouncing your audio files, disable or remove all plugins/ FX. I'll need a dry copy
Clips: Try to avoid clips/clicks/pops by stepping back from the mic & using a pop guard

I will absolutely work some serious magic on every project, but following these steps will help us both.`,

      content: `While the bulk of my music career has involved starting my projects from scratch, creating immersive environments and soundscapes around clients' audio has been something I've excelled at. The ability to put the listener into another world has given me a competitive edge, taking projects to another level you just don't get with other producers.

Being self taught allows me an insane amount of flexibility when it comes to breaking rules producers with a degree in sound engineering will stick to. Whether you're looking for something standard or out of the ordinary, you'll get a unique approach working with me.

Armed with a 2TB sample library, a plethora of instruments and a field mic, there is never a shortage in resources to give your audio the best set of sounds and treatment.

Please note when sending me files for these projects, everything you see in the "things to consider" part of the Mixing & Mastering section above is also applicable here.`,

      title: "Instrumentals",
      content: `A lot of energy goes into every instrumental I produce, but not every beat I've started ends up on the dinner table. Each Mp3 is bounced at the same time as the Wav, after being mixed. Whether you feel like investing in an Wav or stems, or if you'd prefer to keep things economical and just go with an Mp3, it's mutually beneficial for each tier to be treated with care.

Mp3s are 320 kbps. The structure of the beat comes as is, with no edits.
Wavs are 24 bit 48kHz. One structure adjustment.
Stems can be bounced wet or dry. Edit till you're content with the final copy.

Each tier can be upgraded to an Exclusive license at any time. The previous customers who purchased that beat may still use it, but upon your purchase of this license, the instrumental will be ineligible for future leasing of any kind.

License files for your purchases will be provided upon purchase. You can view the terms of each license prior to purchase to make sure you pick the one that fits your needs. Please reach out with any questions.`,

In addition to the list of gear you can see on the home page, we have multiple mics, acoustic and electric guitars, and a drum set on site to for you to incorporate into your project upon request.

Pricing for studio time is $50/hr, and I'm very efficient without sacrificing quality, so you really get your money's worth. Projects are constantly backed up to multiple hard drives. If we're working on something that will take multiple sessions, Google Drive will also be used so we can keep everyone up to date on the progress we're making in real time.

If you need help sourcing live musicians to play live instruments for your project, I have connections that span many genres, all of which are very skilled and reliable. Feel free to reach out so we can discuss your needs.`,

      title: "Distribution & ASCAP",
      content: `When it comes to distributing your content online, there are far more things to consider and accomplish than most people realize. This is going to sound more daunting than it is, but when you're starting out it can be overwhelming.

You need to create a record label all of your work can be organized under, you need to know the exact format of your song title, the artist name, album name, album art (must be a 100% square image down to the pixel). If you want to make lyrics available in apps, the format (spacing, caps etc) has tight parameters.

You'll need to decide whether you'd like to pay extra to have Shazam identify your tracks, and you can enable adding your music to any new stores and social media platforms that come along… The list goes on. Once you get a hang of it, it's like riding a bike, but if you need some help with this part, let me know and I'll help you get it done. Same goes for ASCAP.

My personal preference is to make sure it comes up on Shazam, and that when new stores come out, it's distributed there as well. One example of the new store add on, is TikTok – it's gotten HUGE and is now one of the most popular platforms, so it makes sense to keep up to date with this feature, and having your tracks recognized by Shazam is crucial if you want to keep expanding your audience.`,

      title: "Soundtracks & Commercial Use",
      content: `The soundtrack of a movie or show can take it to a whole new dimension if it's done right. One benefit to me being largely self-taught in my craft, is that it allows me the ability to think outside the box. In the box are rules that every certified sound engineer was trained on. While there are huge benefits to this training, we live in a world where the proof in the pudding means more than the certification on the wall in many cases.

My competitive edge lays in my ability to break the rules, and deliver art that is purely based on the feel and the journey the music needs to take. Building song structures that don't fit the norms is one of my favorite tools in my arsenal.

Too often I hear commercials that sound like they're playing off the speakers of someone's phone or laptop. It seems to be happening more and more often. You can hire me to mix and master the audio for your commercial, purchase instrumentals or have me create an original jingle. Check out the Soundtracks playlist for options that are more fitting than the Beats playlist.

Whatever your commercial project is, I'd love to help. I have licenses for both exclusive and non-exclusive commercial projects. Reach out and let's talk.`,

      title: "AI Visualizers For Your Music",
      content: `Adding a visual element to your music naturally attracts more attention to your work. It's hard keeping up with the parabolic advancement of AI tools we can use to enhance our creativity, but I strive to stay up to date. I utilize cutting edge AI tools and professional video editing software to create visualizers that resonate with the essence of your track.

My standard visualizers are abstract flip book animation, from zoom-in videos to spirals, up, down, side scrolling, and stationary. These 1-take videos are $100 and come in 4k resolution. Other options include watercolor, oil paint and cinematic, and you can choose between vertical and landscape aspect ratios, or just square.

Advanced videos cost more, but turn out amazing. They consist of breaking down lyrics and topics into scenes, trying multiple options and prompts till we get the right result for each scene. I then arrange them in video editing software, and produce a high quality final copy. These are charged hourly at my standard rate of $50/hr.

These prices include the cost I pay for AI processing and upscaling with pro accounts.`,

      title: "Making Music NFTs",
      content: `How much money have you made with your music online or in physical copies of CDs/ records? If you're in the same boat as the rest of us, we get a fraction of a fraction, and even then if we use any of these platforms like Spotify or Apple Music, we're paying them way more than what we're getting in return.

Taking a look at my Distrokid stats, I've made $200 in 4 years. This included me playing my own music non stop on repeat for 3 months to see how much revenue that would generate. After 3 months non stop on 25 platforms, it rendered $12. Every year I get a recurring charge for $8.95 to ensure my music can be Shazamed, and added to any new music stores/ platforms that arise at any time. The cost to payment ratio is disgusting, which is why music NFTs have really grabbed my attention.

In two weeks, I made over $200 selling my first music NFT, and I've only scratched the surface. That's just one single. It made more than all my music combined, in a fraction of the time. That's 100x more profitable than money made from streaming platforms if my music is being streamed 24/7.

Aside from making more money off your music using NFTs, you can include so much more value for the people who support you by purchasing your music. You can create scarcity by capping the total number of copies people can purchase too. I'm also working on ways I can provide mixing and mastering discounts to people who hold certain music NFTs I've sold. The possibilities are endless, and we are super early. There are so few musicians tapping into this world right now, so the earlier you get in, the more this new world is your oyster.

I can't wait to help you get started getting paid what you deserve for your music!`,

      title: "Meditation & Hypnosis",
      content: `While all my relaxation samples are available for free download from this site, custom produced soundscapes can be created for meditation and hypnosis backing audio. You can click the picture to the left to download relaxing tracks from my Soundcloud page "Everybody Sleeps". I created that page to enable everyone to have access to relaxing sounds to improve sleep quality. All free downloads, so check it out!

On the note of creating worlds with sound, "Deep Down" from the "Sleepy" album on the Home page is an example of a soundscape I produced for hypnosis sessions. There is a steady, hypnotic drum pattern in that track with slow panning from left to right, like a pendulum in slow motion. This ties back into me finding inspiration in creating worlds of sound.

If you'd like me to build a specific type of meditation or hypnosis track, we can discuss what you'd like to manifest or focus on and we'll make it happen. You can fully customize the environment, from beaches to rivers, a meadow with slight wind and birds chirping, you name it… Blue sky's the limit. I love making these. Male and female vocals for the guided meditation & hypno tracks are both available.

In addition, if you request a sample type I don't have, I'll still make it happen to the best of my ability.`,

      content: `One of the best things you can add to just about any track to spice it up, is female vocals. Check out "Seed" and "Sloth" on the Portfolio page for reference, and you'll quickly understand the benefits of hiring my wife for female vocals on your song. If you need backup male vocals, that service is available too.

Holly has been a key part of a jazz band, a blues band, an alternative rock band, a hip hop band, countless hooks for hip hop tracks, and her own solo work that spans these genres and more.

I could keep describing what she sounds like, but the best test is for you take a look at the Resume page, and check out "Seed" & "Sloth" both by All the Things, which is comprised of Holly and Russ A Buss. You can also hear her singing in "Hallelujah" from the Voodoo Bed album by Dirty Chai.

If you have a hook written, but need a pristine female voice to take it to the next level, you'll get more than your money's worth every time. She is also an incredibly talented writer, so if you'd like her to write the hook too, that's absolutely in the cards.

Even if you'd just like some vocal textures added to an instrumental… Sky's the limit. Just ask and we'll find a way to meet your needs.`,

      content: `Beat Tags:
If you're a fellow producer selling beats online, you may be interested in protecting your tracks with a beat tag. This is also a great way to amplify your brand. When you purchase a beat tag, it can be your producer name, or a phrase of your choosing.
You will receive a Wav and an Mp3 of your tags, and they can be done with female or male vocals, dry or wet (verb/ delay etc).

Ringtones & Alarms:
If you've checked out my samples of the ocean, rivers, crickets and other sounds to sleep to, you'll know I have a passion for getting as close as possible to a perfect night's sleep.

Thing is, it's not just about what sounds you sleep to; it's also about what you're waking up to. Personally, I believe that waking up to a calming sound that eases you back into the waking world is the way to go.

That's not the case for everyone, but so many alarms are… too alarming. If you'd like to look into this, I'm more than happy to talk shop about making a quick ringtone or alarm for you.`,
